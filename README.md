# 🤖 LLM Agents

A repository focused on the development of AI agents using LLMs, RAG pipelines, embeddings, tools, and modern GenAI techniques.

This project is part of a structured 30-day portfolio plan, aimed at building practical, real-world intelligent systems aligned with current industry standards.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Understand the architecture of LLM-powered agents  
- Build end-to-end RAG systems (retrieval, embeddings, LLM synthesis)
- Implement agents capable of tool use and API orchestration  
- Develop domain-specialized agents (logistics, automotive, productivity, etc.)  
- Document experiments and refine multi-step reasoning techniques  

---

## 🔧 Topics Covered
- LangChain / OpenAI tools  
- Embeddings & vector stores  
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)  
- Multi-step reasoning & agent loops  
- MLOps & LLMOps concepts  
- Integration with real-world APIs
