# llm-agents — Applied GenAI, RAG & LLM Engineering Projects

This repository contains practical projects focused on **Large Language Models (LLMs)**,  
**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, and **AI-powered agents**, developed as part of my  
structured learning track and portfolio-building journey in Applied GenAI.

The goal of this repository is to showcase **hands-on, industry-aligned implementations**,  
using modern LLM tooling and best practices for reasoning, retrieval, and orchestration.

---

## 📌 Objectives of This Repository

- Build a foundation in **LLM engineering**, **RAG pipelines**, and **agent systems**  
- Demonstrate technical understanding through **clean, reproducible, well-documented notebooks**  
- Develop end-to-end GenAI prototypes aligned with real business use-cases  
- Maintain a professional portfolio for AI/ML internship applications

## 📂 Projects

### **Project 03 — RAG Prototype for Technical Document Retrieval**
A full Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, including:

- document loading (PDF/Markdown)
- preprocessing and chunking
- embeddings generation (`text-embedding-3-small`)
- vector store using ChromaDB
- retrieval pipeline (similarity search)
- LLM integration (GPT-4.1 / GPT-4o-mini)
- contextual question-answering
- structured logs and evaluation examples

**Folder:** `Project 03 — Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Prototype/`  
**Status:** Completed  
**Description:** Simple, clean, end-to-end RAG flow for internal technical documentation.  
**Use-Cases:** Querying manuals, procedures, reports, and operational references.

Additional projects will be added to this repository as the learning track progresses.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **OpenAI API** (LLMs + embeddings)  
- **ChromaDB** (vector storage)  
- **LangChain** (loaders, splitting, retrieval utilities)  
- **Python 3.10+**  
- **Jupyter Notebooks**  
- **PyPDF / Markdown Loaders**  

Future projects in this repository may include:

- tool-using agents  
- routing and decision agents  
- multi-document RAG pipelines  
- reranking and metadata filtering  
- evaluation frameworks for RAG  
- simple agent architectures for business workflows

## 🚀 Roadmap

- **[✔] Project 03 — RAG Prototype (baseline, completed)**  
- **[ ] Project 04 — Multi-document RAG with metadata filtering**  
- **[ ] Project 05 — Agent for structured decision-making**  
- **[ ] Project 06 — LLM tool-calling prototype**  
- **[ ] Project 07 — RAG evaluation experiments**  
- **[ ] Project 08 — Streamlit interface (optional)**  

This roadmap evolves continuously as I progress through my GenAI engineering journey.
