# LLM Agents — Day 1 Notes

## What are LLM-powered Agents?
- Systems built on top of LLMs capable of autonomous reasoning and multi-step decision making.
- Can call external tools, APIs, vector databases, and perform tasks beyond basic text generation.
- Form the backbone of modern GenAI workflows used in automation, customer support, personal assistants, and knowledge systems.

## Key Concepts I’m starting to explore:
- Tool calling
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- Multi-step agent loops
- Reasoning frameworks
- Embeddings as long-term memory

More notes coming soon.
